**Notes:**

1. Individual "*.cpp" files are just for examining the code, they could not be run independently. To actually test the program, please use "main.cpp" file.
2. "validity_check_1.h" contains functions to return error if the string is not valid or handle its exceptions and return it in the correct format (Only for exercise 1).
